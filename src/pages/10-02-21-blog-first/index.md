In this article, I describe the quick way to install your first gatsby project.

**Requirements**

> Make sure that you already installed the [Node.js]('https://nodejs.org/en/') latest version in your system. If not then download it first

**Install in window**

Heere are some few steps:

- First Open your terminal (gitbash, cmd, cmder etc...) which you're using for your project.

- Then run the `gatsby-cli` command in your terminal.
```
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```
This command is used first time in your system for gatsby installation.

- Then run simple command 
```
gatsby new YourProjectName
```

- chage your working directory running change directory command: 
```
cd YourProjectName
```

- Then run `gatsby` command
```
gatsby develop

OR

npm run develop
```

- Finally you installed your First gatsby project.

> ***Note***: The CLI command is used for first time to install the gatsby cli. If you want to install gatsby project second time just go through `gatsby new ProjectName`
